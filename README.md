UNCC Bootcamp assignment for Pandas

In this assigment, I have taken the role of lead analyst to go through data produced by a gaming company for their newest title "Heroes of Pymoli". While it is a free-to-play (FTP) game, purchases are encouraged for various items to be used during gameplay. The company has asked for a comprehensive summary of purchases in the following categories:

Purchasing Analysis: Number of unique items, average purchase price, total number of purchases, and total revenue.

Gender Demographics: Percentage and count of male players, percentage and count of female players, percentage count of other/non-disclosed players.

Gender-Based Purchase Analysis: Purchase count, average price, total purchase value, and average purchase total spent by gender.

Age Demographics: Purchase count, average purchase price, total purchase value, and average purchase total by age group.

Top Spenders: Identify top five spenders and provide- screenname, purchase count, average price, and total purchase value.

Most Popular Items: Identify top five items by purchase count and provide- item id, item name, purchase count, item price, and total price value.

Most Profitable Items: Itentify top five items by purchase value(price) and provide- item id, item name, purchase count, item price, and total price value.

Then provide a written analysis with three observable trends regarding the data provided.
